This was originally a text document to list out the software details so my group mates knew the status and how to contribute.
However they did not participate in the project so I am changing this file to be a description of the software and how to use it.

Animaster is an animation compilation software that can be used in combination with the raspberry pi for dynamic compilation of 
animations of captured images.

To use Animaster: 
Run the Main.py file. From here you are presented two choices, the image capture feature only works if you are using a raspberry pi 
in combination with a raspberry pi camera. If I get time in the future I will change this to communicate with an image scanner for 
more professional use cases. 

Once you select the animation library option you can run any of the preloaded animations that exist within your designated image folder
the ones currently listed are examples from my ImageFolder and for you to use them change the name of "ImageFolder" to match the folder
where you are storing all your animation frames and change the various values of InputHolder like "Micky" to fit the names of your subfolders. 

Have fun animating - Chandler Dees, TheLaddestLad.

Hardware notes: 

For the raspberry pi 4, if it is failing to display, ensure the back cables are fully and firmly plugged in FIRST
then AFTER that plug in to the outlet. 

Connects to internet easily via lan, no setup needed

BIG NOTE:
For all of the functions that use execvp on the raspberry pi it needs the command "python3" rather than "python"
It will not work on the raspberry pi at all unless that specific change is made!
