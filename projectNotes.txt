Hardware notes: 

For the raspberry pi 4, if it is failing to display, ensure the back cables are fully and firmly plugged in FIRST
then AFTER that plug in to the outlet. 

Connects to internet easily via lan, no setup needed

BIG NOTE:
For all of the functions that use execvp on the raspberry pi it needs the command "python3" rather than "python"
It will not work on the raspberry pi at all unless that specific change is made!
