Hardware notes: 

For the raspberry pi 4, if it is failing to display, ensure the back cables are fully and firmly plugged in FIRST
then AFTER that plug in to the outlet. 

Connects to internet easily via lan, no setup needed

****CURRENT TOP PRIORITY***** 
AnimationFoldTest - need to be able to access specific subfolders within in the image folder on command
    - takes command from user gui to load specific subfolder 

Looking into how to implement.

===============================================================================================================================
AnimationFoldTest backup plan - worst case scenario, we put all animations in one folder and let it play as one continous video 
                                since it already works when used for just one video 
===============================================================================================================================

Images captured by the camera will be appended to a list and this list will be cleared everytime the software runs
    - potentially add a feature for them to save these frames as their own animation and add it to the folder of image subfolders 

UserSettings - needs to open from the UserGuiTemp file. Within this file we need the ability to edit the settings within the main file 
             - *** We need to be able to do this without it launching the pygame and running itself. 

UserGuiTemp - Using third party tkinter software to make it look much better. 
    *! Had to use: pip install customtkinter

----------------------------------------
1 - 27 - 23 updates
The image capture python folder now functions and takes pictures of the user according to a button press, then appends those images to the
end of a list in order to run the animation software using that list. Issue lies in GPIO implementation rather than kb input. And a black 
screen is all that is visible while taking pictures. The pictures still work however we want the user to be able to see themselves when taking 
them. 

Also we can *OPTIONALLY* add the feature to save these animations. This feature will be low prirority as we need to get the overall thing working 
before we implement any bonus features like this. 

*CURRENT TOP PRIORITY* - getting the subfolders to work with AnimationFoldTest. And getting the camera to show the user for ImageCapture.py. 
The settings feature can be put off until these are both working fully, same with the ability to save users captured images. 

*SECOND PRIORITY(EASIER TO DO) - taking our current userGUI and getting it in CustomTkinter, the much better looking version. Same commands for the 
buttons but just hopefully nicer looking. 

---------------------------------------
2 - 2 - 24 updates

subfolder implementation is now funcitonal.
There are working keybinds now within the main animation software. 
    -> this removes the need for a settings menu as the details can be changed with a button press while the software is running. 

Need to add ability for tkinter window to provide argument which will choose the correct animation subfolder to preload 

---------------------------------------
2 - 3 - 24 

the image capture was being an absolute pain and getting it to function required a strong departure from the original version
however this version works well.

Preloaded animation selection for individual subfolders is now fully implemented

---------------------------------------
2 - 5 - 24 

Get LEDs to react to keyboard press

Transfer current GUI to customtkinter

Add more preloaded animations 

Adjust and ensure the GUI window size fits the Pi
